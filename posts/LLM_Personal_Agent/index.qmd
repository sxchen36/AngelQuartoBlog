### Key Concept
**Vector-embedding**: Also called vector representation, or sometimes just vector. Represents real-world objects and concepts as a set of continuous numbers. Usually created by training models (ex. Word2Vec for text data, VGG for image data)
**Semantic Similarity**: how close objects' vectors are in the vector space. It can be measured with many similariy measures, typical examples: Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Dot product
**Similarity Search**: Also called vector search. Given a set of vectors and a query vector, we need to find the most similar items in our set for the query, aka the nearest vectors to the query vector.
**Index** Verb: Index vectors means using some algorithm transform the vector representation into a compressed form to optimize the query process.  Ex. Without indexing, similarity search will check distances between each vector in the space (K Nearest Neighbors KNN search) . While with indexing, we can narrow down the search space thus improve lookup times. It's being used as part of the Approximately Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search
